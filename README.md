# Womenâ€™s Safety App â€” UI/UX Prototype

This repository contains a visual prototype for a mobile app designed to support women's safety in public spaces. The prototype was created using Figma as part of a "Tech for Good" initiative, focusing on how design and technology can empower vulnerable communities.

## ðŸ§  Project Purpose

This app explores how intuitive, accessible UI/UX design can be used to:
- Help women feel safer while travelling or walking alone.
- Provide quick access to emergency contacts and location sharing.
- Enable community reporting of suspicious incidents.

The design balances usability with urgency, making key features easy to access under stress.
